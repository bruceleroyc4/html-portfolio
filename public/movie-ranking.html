<h1>The Best Movies According to Bruce</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2> 
<hr/>
<h3>The Last Dragon - 1985</h3>
<p>You had to have been there. 1980s, New York, Rap and R&B, and proper homage to Bruce Lee. How can you go wrong?</p>
<h3>RAD - 1986</h3>
<p>Cult classic! True underdog story that tugs at the heartstrings with some classic 1980s motivational montage music. It's Rocky on a bicycle.</p>
<h3>A Few Good Men - 1992</h3>
